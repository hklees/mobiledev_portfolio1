I added a Suggested Pairing line under each menu item by adding “itemPairing:” and a description under each item in the App.js file and this.props.itemPairing inside export default MenuItem in the MenuItem index.js file.
I also changed the appearance of the page by added CSS in the index.css file, changing the font-family, background color and styling to the buttons.
