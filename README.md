# mobiledev_portfolio1
I added to lab 4 for Mobile Development Portfolio 1. I added a "Suggested Pairing" text under each menu item by adding “itemPairing:” and a description under each item in the App.js file and this.props.itemPairing inside export default MenuItem in the MenuItem index.js file.
I also changed the appearance of the page by adding CSS in the index.css file, changing the font-family, background color and styling to the buttons.
