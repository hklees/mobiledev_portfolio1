# mobiledev_portfolio1
I added to lab 4 for Mobile Development Portfolio 1. I used a functional component to display an alert that tells the user how many times they added an item to their cart when the user clicks the Add to Cart button under any item. 
I used another functional component to display text at under each item that says Ask the Waiter for Dietary Options. 

Other things I changed:
I added a "Suggested Pairing" text under each menu item by adding “itemPairing:” and a description under each item in the App.js file and this.props.itemPairing inside export default MenuItem in the MenuItem index.js file. I also changed the appearance of the page by adding CSS in the index.css file, changing the font-family, background color and styling to the buttons.
